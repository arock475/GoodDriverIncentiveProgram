Sample standard json API implementation:

Request format
GET request to a url with the header being some authorization method, like a Bearer token
with query parameters indicated by ? at the end of the url and & for each additional parameter:
example:
curl -X GET 'https://truckerincentive.com/api/driver?id=123&raw=true' 
-H 'Auth: Bearer oiqwjeo12830123jqlwkej'

We sent a request to the driver endpoint with the query parameter for id (123) and set a boolean parameter 'raw'
to true.

The response json would look something like this:
{
    "data": [{
        id: 123
        name: "Driver Name",
        points: 321
    }],
    "err": 2,
    "errmsg": ''
}

And we would send specific html error codes to indiciate errors and populate errmsg with a contextual 
explanation for the error that may have occured.
