We would first want to select a good linux distro to run on the server, then indicate 
an amazon machine image that is for that OS. For example we could use the default AWS Linux image.

Then we can select the actual compute hardware the server will run on, such as a micro server or something larger.
Since the workload on this project won't be an actual production workload, we can probably select a small box.

After that we can setup the VPC subnet so we can have more granular control network permissions for our 
API versus the internet facing website. This is in tandum with the security group that gets assigned to the EC2
that can control who can connect to the server, such as team members. 

Then we would have to consider storage, such as EBS to have the storage accessable directly from the EC2 instance
on disk. Or we could make an S2 bucket that can be used by the EC2 instance to host certain types of content, such 
as profile pictures.

We should then tag our EC2 to ensure that its organized under our team.

Then we can SSH into the EC2 instance once we setup the security group correctly.
