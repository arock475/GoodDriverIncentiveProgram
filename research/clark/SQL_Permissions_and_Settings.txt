https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/permissions-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16

	Every SQL Server has associated permissions that can be granted to various users. They can managed at a server level or at a database level depending on which permissions are needed to be granted. 
    There are a total of 248 different permissions with Azure SQL having 254. To apply a permissions, use the following template:

GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::HumanResources TO role_HumanResourcesDept;
REVOKE SELECT ON SCHEMA::HumanResources TO role_HumanResourcesDept;

Some important permissions that can be assigned are:
	Control – gives ownership level permissions to a user
	Alter/Alter Any – gives the user to alter anything except ownership level permissions
	Impersonate – Impersonate different user permissions
	Create – The user can create server/database objects
	View Definition – User can view metadata
	References – Used to create foreign keys/functions/views
    
All of the above permissions have sub permissions that can limit different things the user can do depending on what is needed. To see all permissions on a database and/or server, use the following command: 
	SELECT * FROM fn_builtin_permissions(default);
    GO;
