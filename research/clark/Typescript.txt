Typescript:
	https://www.typescriptlang.org/
Typescript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration/catch errors early with the editor. It can run anywhere (browser, Node.js, Deno, apps, etc.) and uses type inference which gives great tooling without additional code. 
Example of type checker when using Typescript: 
const obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };
const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
“Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?”
While the above is not a syntax error, the type checker can check the JavaScript type and provide useful feedback. Same with something like 4/[] which is valid, but will not produce any output/could segfault
Object/Type creation example:
	const user = {
 		 name: "Hayes",
  		id: 0,
}; <- Creates an object with the inferred type which includes name: string and id: number
You also can create interfaces that can be used to create future objects with that type.
