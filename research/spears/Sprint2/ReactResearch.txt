React components are reusable bits of code that return HTML

There are function components and class components
All component names must be capitilized

Class components
Class components must include "extends React.Component" to create inheritance to React.Component
This gives access to all of React.Component's functions
The component also requires a render() methdos that returns HTML

Function components
A function component also returns HTML but Function components include less code and are simpler
A function component is basically a function from any other language that returns HTML

Rendering a Component
to render something you do root.render(<FUNCTION NAME />);

Components can be passed as props (properties)
Properties are like function arguments and can pass properties like colors or size

Components can be refered to inside of components (like functions normally)

React suggests seperating components into separate files in order to easily reuse it
then you import these files using import X from PATH


Components allow you to make pieces of a frontend and reuse it in many places
This will allow us to write fewer lines of code to do the same thing
