GoChi is a second Golang backend framework.

The main differences between GoChi and Gin are that 
GoChi is more lightweight. Gin also is quite restrictive
in the fact that we would only be able to use Gin components.

In otherwords GoChi is more lightweight and is compatible with a larger
number of things

This makes GoChi better for our purposes.

Some more things about GoChi is that it is fast (which is a plus for us, we don't want
our application to be slowed down by our technologies)

compatible with .net/http (which is good for our purposes)

GoChi is also designed for usage with modular and large API systems
Since this is our goal this make GoChi a pretty good choice, it will allow us to keep our system managable

Go Chi also has automatic documentation using docgen
    THis will make our lives easier by not having to do as much documenting ourselves

There are many more features of GoChi that I am sure we will either end up utilizing
or at least consider using. GoChi seems like the better choice for our purposes.
