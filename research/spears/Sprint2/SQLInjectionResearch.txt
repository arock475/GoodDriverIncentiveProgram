SQL injection is the action of placing malicious code inside of existing SQL statements via webpage input
The basic premise is that anywhere you ask the user for input that instead of said input they give SQL statements that will be unconsciously run on the database.

In some cases the attack will be based on 1=1 always being true.
    For example putting the input 105 or 1=1 when placed into a SELECT query could return all rows in a table

In other cases the attack will be based on ""="" always being true. This works under the same premise as the above case but for string input

Then there are injection attacks based on Batched SQL statements
    Batched SQL statements are groups of 2+ SQL statements separated by semicolons
    In these kinds of attacks things like
        SELECT * FROM Users; DROP TABLE Suppliers
    will return all rows from the Users table and then delete the Suppliers table.

In order to protect from injection attacks one can use SQL Parameters
    SQL Parameters are values that are added to SQL query at execution time in a controlled way.
    
    The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and to ensure that it is not part of the SQL to be executed.
