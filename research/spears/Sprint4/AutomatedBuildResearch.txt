Build Pipelines are the backbone of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment environments

Build Pipelines include everything from running automated tests, to deploying in a production environment, to compiling code. 

In our case I currently plan to run our automated test (that is our professional skill) and also have the pipeline place committed code directly
into our production environment

Azure provides a tool to do this in their pipelines section which is what I will be using in order to achieve this.

This research is short but I will likely be doing slighly more research as I actually implement this in our project
