Ebay has a quite large API selection. There are multiple categories of API that allow one to buy/sell/analyze various items and statistics

In our project we will be using one main API that Ebay provides, the Browse API.

This API allows one to create a selection of Ebay's items based on category or filter.

The API also allows one to add individual desired items to the selection if necessary

This is perfect for our project's needs as we want sponsors to be able to choose what they want from Ebay to have in their catalog

We will be making some sort of frontend around this API in order to allow for the sponsors to create a catalog without having to 
go through the actual endpoints and commands for the API

The API provides a series of methods that allow for all manner of searching and sorting items from Ebay's inventory

some of these methods are by name, by image, and by category.


I have also created an Ebay Developer Account and am in the process of being aproved
