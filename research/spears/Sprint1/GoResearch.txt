I have installed Go and written and run a few basic lines of Go code.

In these lines I have learned the basic syntax including assignment and loops as well as functions and packages.
Go does not have a specific keyword for while loops so you would use a simplified for loop in that case.

Got me started with Go including how to download it

Gave good resources for most of the syntax that I have learned

Explained the differences between = and := in Go 
(:= allows for ommiting the data type by assigning the new variable to the type of the assigned data)
For example x := 10 would make x an integer and x := "yes" would make it a string
Without the := assignment is done as var x int = 10 for example

If you plan to run my GoTest.go file you would have to have go downloaded and then run "go run GoTest.go" or "go run ."
