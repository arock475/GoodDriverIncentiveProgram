EC2 or Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud is a service that allows for the creation of virtual machines in the cloud
Each of these virtual machines or instances are able to be configured in many ways such as
    The AMI or Amazon Machine Image which is basically a template operating system that can come with a varitey of preinstalled software
    The Instance type which includes the amount of storage, ram, the CPU speed, and the network performance
    The network settings which include the VPC and the Subnet, this also includes whether or not a public IP is necessary or not
        These settings are crucial for public facing instances (as these settings allow for it to be public facing), as well as private ones
    Attaching an IAM role (this is optional normally but required if it will be interacting with other AWS services) 
        The IAM role allows for the instance to make API calls while protecting the AWS credentials of the owner
    The user data script which is an optional script that will customize the environment of the instance and can populate data
    Specifying storage which allows for adding extra storage volumes to an instance 
    Tags which are one of the most important parts as it provides metadata on the instance and allows you to distinguish between them
    Security group settings which is the firewall rules. These rules control the traffic that can reach or leave an instance
        These are very important to public facing instances and will likely be key in our project
    Identifying or Creating the Key pair. at launch you select or create a key pair that will allow secure connections to the instance (SSHing or logging in)

    EC2 instances are what will run our code and allow it to become a webapp (accessible from any browser)
    These instances are crucial to this project and further learning will happen through setting up and utilizing the EC2 instance(s) that we use in the future.
