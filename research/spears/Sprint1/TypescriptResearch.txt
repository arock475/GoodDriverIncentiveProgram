Typescript is basically javascript with types

Typescript can be used the same way as javascript but with the added simplicity of types and editors that 
can help detect type errors as well as other errors.

When I first used javascript I had a large amount of simple type errors due to not being able to easily check what 
type a variable was, I (as well as my group) feel that Typescript will help us to have less errors in our code
than if we used javascript.

Typescript's main goal is to limit the amount of time spent fixing TypeErrors that could have been avoided had there been
a mechanism to check the type of somehting without just "running the code to see what happens".

Typescript is a static typechecker which allows us to find TypeErrors BEFORE the code is run
Typescript also changes the behavior of what happens when a property that does not exist is envoked

For example in Javascript 

const user = {
  name: "Daniel",
  age: 26,
};
user.location; // returns undefined

user.location returns undefined while in Typescript it throws an error. This allows for mistakes to be fixed
much earlier in typescript than in javascript due to the speed in which errors can be found

Typescript also can detect normal bugs such as typos, operator errors, and basic logic errors

Typescript, since the types are static, can suggest properties of the object as you are typing (which javascript can not)

Overall Typescript is going to make our lives much easier than just using simple javascript for everything
