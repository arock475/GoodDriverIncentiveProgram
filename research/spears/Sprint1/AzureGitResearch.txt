This is actually made much easier than expected by Azure.

Since we are using the built in repository it is as simple as opening the story and selecting the "add link" button
under development. 

Then simply either use the commit ID or select the commit/pull request that is relevant to the story that you are on.

This will then link the story and the commit/pull request/branch

This ended up being way easier than any of us expected
