GIT is a version control system that is used in most industry jobs. It is exceptionally versatile and useful.

I have personally learned and used git one time. However we used it very infrequently and I never learned 
adequately enough for my liking. This document will likely be short on account of me not needing much of a refresher 
I mostly want a cheatsheet of sorts for myself on what each GIT command does and the basics.

The basic git workflow is as follows

I have a local file that is in a local repository.
If I make a change to said local file I would then need to update the master repository as well as commit the changes to my local repository

To do so I would first need to stage the changes by doing git add
Then I would need to commit the  changes to the local repository (using git commit -m "something")

Then from there I could do git push origin master to push it onto the remote master repository

This is the basic workflow of git but normally branches are in the mix as well

The main change here is that all commits would be going onto the local branch, this said branch would then be merged with the local repository,
Then after that merge you would push to the master repository

This allows for multiple people to work and commit simultaenously while limiting the number of merge conflicts that happen

OVERALL WORKFLOW

make branch
make changes
stage changes
commit changes
merge branch to local
push changes to master
