· Git stores commits as commit objects that have points to the snapshot of changed content
and the author's name and email, commit message, and points to commit(s) that came before
· Git branches are movable pointers to commits
· Default branch is master
· git branch (name) ; creates a new branch at the current head pointer
· git checkout lets you switch branches
· Branch divergence occurs when two different commits occur from the same parent commit
    · Ex: Two different developers commit on different branches from master
· Need to merge branches to combine them again
· Merge conflicts occur when two branches made changes to the same code
