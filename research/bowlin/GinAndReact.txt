· The application should have backend and frontend directories
    · Backend will have GO files
    · Front end will have the ReactJS files 
· Node.JS is required to run the ReactJS portion
· Websockets can be used instead of polling to fetch/update information in real time
    · Alternatively, information can be statically loaded on page loads
· The frontend can fetch data from the backend using HTTP requests
    · Should make the routes the same for the backend and frontend, but should add /api to the front of the routes for the backend
